django-flatblocks-xtd
=====================

django-flatblocks-xtd is a fork of django-flatblocks that uses `TextFieldWithInlines` rather than `TextFields` so that you can add inline content to your flatblocks. 

It uses django-inline-media and it's under development yet, so don't dare to use it or you will swear heavily...
